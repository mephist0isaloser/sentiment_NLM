## Introduction

This collection of projects demonstrates various techniques and methods for text preprocessing and sentiment analysis. From basic text cleaning to advanced machine learning models, these projects offer insights into how to prepare and analyze text data effectively.

## Getting Started

Before using any of the projects, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn keras
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the specific project directory you're interested in.

3. Modify the scripts as needed and provide the appropriate file paths for your data.

4. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Preprocessing Steps

The [preprocess_tweets.py](preprocess_tweets.py) script performs essential text preprocessing steps on tweet data. It cleans and prepares text data for further analysis, including removing emojis, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords, cleaning text (e.g., URLs, usernames, hashtags, punctuation), lemmatization, and tokenization.

## Text Classification Using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

The [text_classification.py](text_classification.py) script demonstrates a simple text classification pipeline using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Logistic Regression. It loads preprocessed tweet data, creates TF-IDF vectors, splits the data, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its accuracy.

## Text Classification Using TF-IDF with N-grams and Logistic Regression

The [advanced_text_classification.py](advanced_text_classification.py) script showcases a more advanced text classification pipeline using TF-IDF vectors with N-grams (word sequences of varying lengths) and Logistic Regression. This project is designed to capture more complex patterns and relationships within the text data.

## Sentiment Analysis Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

The [sentiment_analysis_cnn.py](sentiment_analysis_cnn.py) script presents a deep learning approach to sentiment analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project utilizes CNN architecture to classify tweet sentiment labels into predefined categories (e.g., positive or negative sentiment).
