## Introduction

This script utilizes Python and popular libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `nltk`, and `re` to preprocess tweet data. The preprocessing steps include removing emojis, converting text to lowercase, removing stopwords, cleaning text (e.g., URLs, usernames, hashtags, punctuation), lemmatization, and tokenization.

## Getting Started

To use this script, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk
```

Additionally, make sure to download NLTK resources for stopwords and lemmatization by uncommenting the relevant lines in the script:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Modify the script as needed and provide the appropriate file paths for your data.

3. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python preprocess_tweets.py
```

## Preprocessing Steps

The following preprocessing steps are performed on the tweet data:

1. Removal of emojis.
2. Conversion of text to lowercase.
3. Removal of stopwords (commonly used words without significant meaning).
4. Cleaning of text by removing URLs, usernames, hashtags, and punctuation.
5. Lemmatization of words to their base form.
6. Tokenization of text into individual words.

# Text Classification Using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

This is a simple example of performing text classification using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Logistic Regression. The script demonstrates how to preprocess text data, create TF-IDF vectors, split the data into training and testing sets, train a logistic regression model, and evaluate its accuracy.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates a more advanced text classification pipeline using TF-IDF vectors with N-grams (word sequences of varying lengths) and Logistic Regression. The primary objective is to classify sentiment labels for text data into predefined categories (e.g., positive or negative sentiment). The inclusion of N-grams allows the model to capture more complex patterns and relationships within the text.

## Getting Started

To utilize this project, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. Install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Modify the script as needed and provide the appropriate file path for your preprocessed tweet data (assuming it's saved as `processed_tweets.csv`).

3. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

```bash
python advanced_text_classification.py
```

## Results

The script executes the following steps:

1. Loads preprocessed tweet data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Creates TF-IDF vectors with N-grams from the tweet data.
3. Divides the data into training and testing sets.
4. Trains a logistic regression model on the training data.
5. Predicts sentiment labels on the test set using the trained model.
6. Calculates and displays the accuracy of the model.

The script executes the following steps:

1. Loads preprocessed tweet data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Divides the data into features (tweets) and labels (sentiment).
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Initializes CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
5. Builds a CNN model using Keras with layers for embedding, convolution, pooling, and dense units.
6. Compiles and trains the CNN model on the training data.
